# API Documentation

The frontend of the debates-app communicates with the backend via an API: the following routes are currently implemented:

- **POST /get-media-urls**: gets presigned urls for the media to play from S3, needs S3 path of the media
- **POST /get-metadata**: gets all metadata from the MongoDB
- **POST /search-solr**: gets search results for a specific search from Solr
- **POST /update-speakers**: updates speaker information in the MongoDB
- **POST /update-subtitles**: updates subtitles information in the MongoDB

The specification below was autogenerated as `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` in the setup with [docker-compose](../install/compose.md)
